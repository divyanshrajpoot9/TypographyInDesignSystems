## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses a variety of tags to structure web content. These tags provide the basic building blocks for creating web pages. 
## Here's a brief description of some of the most commonly used HTML general tags:

1. `<!DOCTYPE>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It typically appears at the very beginning of an HTML document.

2. `<html>`: The root element that wraps all other HTML elements on the page.

3. `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character set, and linked stylesheets.

4. `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

5. `<meta>`: Provides metadata about the document, including character encoding, author information, and keywords for search engines.

6. `<link>`: Used to link external resources such as stylesheets (CSS) to the HTML document.

7. `<style>`: Allows you to define inline CSS styles for elements within the document.

8. `<script>`: Used to embed JavaScript code or reference external JavaScript files.

9. `<body>`: Contains the main content of the web page, including text, images, and other elements visible to the user.

10. `<h1>`: Headings that create a hierarchical structure for the content, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest.

11. `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.

12. `<a>`: Creates hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.

13. `<img>`: Embeds images in the document.

14. `<div>`: A versatile container element used for grouping and styling content.

15. `<span>`: A generic inline container for text and other inline elements.





These are some of the fundamental HTML tags that web developers use to structure and format web content. There are many more HTML elements available for specific purposes, but these are some of the most commonly used ones for creating web pages.
